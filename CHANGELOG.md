## [v1.4.0] - 2025-11-23
### 🚀 Major Features
- Multi-Site Support: Added dedicated tabs for Adobe Stock and iStock.
- iStock Exporter: Generates individual CSV files for each image and bundles them into a single ZIP file download.

- EPS Extension Handling: All exported CSVs now automatically reference filenames with .eps extensions (replacing .jpg/.png) to match vector submission workflows.

### 🏗️ Architecture (OOP Refactor)
- Refactored monolithic app.py into a modular Object-Oriented structure:
  - models.py: Handles AI model loading (BLIP/KeyBERT) and inference.
  - exporters.py: Contains logic for Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and iStock exporters.
  - app.py: Main entry point orchestrating the UI tabs.

### ⚡ Improvements
- Fast Model Loading: Enabled use_fast=True for BLIP processor to remove Hugging Face warnings and improve speed.
